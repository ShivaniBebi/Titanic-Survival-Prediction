# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
This project predicts passenger survival from the Titanic disaster using machine learning. Leveraging logistic regression and exploratory data analysis (EDA), it aims to build a reliable classification model based on passenger attributes like age, class, gender, and fare.

* Key Features
  
Cleaned and visualized the Titanic dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
Applied Logistic Regression from Scikit-learn for binary classification
Achieved ~80% training accuracy and ~81% test accuracy
Evaluated performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix
Implemented train-test split for validation

* Tech Stack
  
Python
NumPy & Pandas
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix)
